ASSESSMENT: React Tax Calculator Component Evaluation

PROMPT ANALYSIS:
The prompt requests a React component for UK tax calculation with:
- Number input for annual income
- State-controlled text area for displaying results
- 2023/2024 tax bands implementation
- Caching to prevent performance issues

RESPONSE 1 EVALUATION:
✅ Provides React component code
✅ Has state for annual income (useState)
✅ No props used
✅ Includes correct 2023/2024 tax bands
✅ Has calculateIncomeTax function
✅ Function takes one integer argument
❌ Function returns float, not integer (returns tax with decimals)
❌ Missing text area - uses div for display instead
✅ Implements caching with useMemo
✅ Code appears to run without syntax errors

RESPONSE 2 EVALUATION:
✅ Provides React component code
✅ Has state for annual income (useState)
✅ No props used
✅ Includes correct 2023/2024 tax bands
✅ Has simulateHeavyTaxCalculation function
✅ Function takes one integer argument
❌ Function returns float, not integer (returns tax with decimals)
❌ Missing text area - uses div for display instead
❌ Poor caching implementation - useCallback doesn't cache results
❌ Manual calculation trigger doesn't match prompt requirements
✅ Code appears to run without syntax errors

CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

Response 1:
- Tax calculation logic has a fundamental error in the tax band implementation
- The function doesn't return an integer as required
- Missing textarea element as specified in prompt

Response 2:
- Same tax calculation logic error
- Same integer return requirement violation
- Same missing textarea issue
- Ineffective caching - useCallback memoizes function reference, not results
- Requires manual button click instead of automatic calculation

TAX CALCULATION LOGIC ERROR (Both Responses):
The tax bands are incorrectly implemented. The current logic applies rates to ranges incorrectly:
- Should be: Income £0-£12,570 = 0%, £12,571-£50,270 = 20%, etc.
- Current code: Applies rates incorrectly due to flawed band logic

FINAL VERDICT:
Response 1 is significantly better than Response 2.

JUSTIFICATION:
1. **Better Caching**: Response 1 uses useMemo which actually caches calculation results, while Response 2's useCallback only memoizes the function reference without caching results.

2. **Better User Experience**: Response 1 automatically recalculates when income changes, matching the prompt's expectation of immediate feedback. Response 2 requires manual button clicks.

3. **Closer to Requirements**: Response 1 is closer to the prompt's intent of real-time calculation with proper result caching.

4. **Simpler Implementation**: Response 1 follows React best practices with automatic derived state, while Response 2 adds unnecessary complexity with manual triggers.

Both responses fail to fully meet requirements (missing textarea, incorrect return type, tax logic errors), but Response 1 is substantially better in implementation quality and user experience.

RECOMMENDATION: Choose Response 1, but note that both responses would need corrections to fully satisfy the requirements.
