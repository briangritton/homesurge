                  You can request to exercise your information, access and

                  or deletion rights. As part of this process, government

                  California’s “Shine the Light” law (California Civil Code §
                  1798.83) allows California residents to ask companies with
                  whom they have formed a business relationship primarily for
                  personal, family or household purposes to provide certain
                  information about the companies’ sharing of certain personal
                  information with third parties for their direct marketing
                  purposes during the preceding year (if any). You can submit
                  such a request by sending an email to
                  contact@SellForCash.Online with “Shine the Light” in the
                  subject line. The request must include your current name,
                  street address, city, state, and zip code and attest to the
                  fact that you are a California resident.
