You're correct - to use campaign_name and adgroup_name in Google Analytics audiences and reports, you need to register them as either custom
  dimensions or event parameters.

  Since the data is already being pushed to the dataLayer with your events (as seen in your GTM preview), you just need to:

  1. Create custom dimensions in GA4:
    - Go to Google Analytics > Admin > Custom Definitions > Custom Dimensions
    - Create new custom dimensions for campaign_name and adgroup_name
    - Set the scope to "Event" (since they're being sent with events)
  2. Configure GTM to send these to GA4:
    - In GTM, edit your GA4 event tag that handles the api_value event
    - Make sure your tag is configured to send these parameters
    - You can either:
        - Map them as event parameters (simpler, but less reporting options)
      - Map them to custom dimensions (more powerful for reporting)

  For custom dimensions, your tag configuration would look something like:

  // In your GA4 event tag
  customDimensions: {
    campaign_name: {{DLV - campaign_name}},
    adgroup_name: {{DLV - adgroup_name}}
  }

  The reason you don't see them as options for audience creation is that GA4 only shows parameters it has actually received and processed. After you
  configure them properly and get some events flowing through, they should appear in the audience builder options.

  If you've already sent events with these parameters but they're not showing up, it means GA4 isn't recognizing them - typically because:
  1. They weren't properly mapped in your GA4 configuration tag
  2. They weren't registered as custom dimensions in GA4

  For a quick test, you could:
  1. Add a custom GA4 parameter configuration to your tags
  2. Wait 24-48 hours for data collection
  3. Check if they appear in Audience builder

  Would you like me to look at your current GTM setup for the GA4 event tag to make sure it's configured correctly?

> Could I just add a tag/trigger whatever that fires all of this campaign info I might want to use for audience or report qualifiers at once?  Rather 
  than have it attached to a specific event, just fire all URL paramaters as variables within a page load type initial event?

⏺ Yes, that's an excellent approach! You can create a single GA4 event that captures all URL campaign parameters on page load, which is much more
  efficient than attaching them to specific events.

  Here's how to implement this:

  1. Create a new GA4 event tag in GTM:
    - Name it something like "Campaign Parameters"
    - Event name: "campaign_data" (or whatever makes sense)
    - Configure it to send all campaign parameters as event parameters
  2. Set up a Page View trigger:
    - Set it to fire on "Page View - DOM Ready" (or Window Loaded)
    - Add a condition that only fires when URL parameters exist (optional)

  This approach has several advantages:
  - Captures campaign data for all users immediately
  - Makes the data available for all subsequent events/audiences
  - Reduces redundancy in your event parameters
  - Simplifies your configuration

  Here's a sample configuration:

  // GA4 Event tag configuration
  event_name: 'campaign_data',
  event_parameters: {
    campaign_source: {{URL Parameter - utm_source}} || {{URL Parameter - traffic_source}},
    campaign_medium: {{URL Parameter - utm_medium}},
    campaign_name: {{URL Parameter - campaign_name}} || {{URL Parameter - campaignname}} || {{URL Parameter - utm_campaign}},
    campaign_id: {{URL Parameter - campaign_id}} || {{URL Parameter - campaignid}},
    campaign_term: {{URL Parameter - keyword}} || {{URL Parameter - utm_term}},
    campaign_content: {{URL Parameter - utm_content}},
    adgroup_name: {{URL Parameter - adgroup_name}} || {{URL Parameter - adgroupname}},
    adgroup_id: {{URL Parameter - adgroup_id}} || {{URL Parameter - adgroupid}},
    gclid: {{URL Parameter - gclid}},
    device: {{URL Parameter - device}},
    matchtype: {{URL Parameter - matchtype}}
  }

  Since you've already standardized your parameter naming in the code, this should work seamlessly. After implementing this, your campaign parameters
  will be available for audience creation in GA4 (after some data collection).

  Would you like me to provide the specific GTM configurations for setting this up?

> so if I did this, and let's say API Value fired separately, I could set up audiences that have conditionals on a specific campaign or ad group, as 
  well as a conditional for API Value fired?  Last thing, for the actual value of API Value, does that need to be coming through specifically as one of 
  the custom parameters attached to the API Value fired event as it comes in?

⏺ Yes, absolutely. You can combine conditions from different events when creating GA4 audiences. Here's how it would work:

  1. Your "campaign_data" event fires on page load, sending all campaign parameters
  2. Your "api_value" event fires separately when that specific action occurs

  When creating an audience in GA4, you can set up conditions like:
  - Users who had an "api_value" event AND
  - Where their "campaign_data" event had campaign_name = "specific_campaign"

  For the actual apiValue amount, yes - it needs to be included as a parameter in the "api_value" event. GA4 will only have access to parameters sent
  with that specific event. The way you're currently sending it looks correct:

  dataLayer.push({
    event: "api_value",
    apiValue: "554000",
    propertyAddress: "6318 Station Mill Dr, Norcross, GA 30092, USA",
    formattedValue: "$554,000",
    // ... other parameters
  })

  To ensure GA4 properly registers this value for audience creation:

  1. Make sure your GA4 event tag for "api_value" includes this parameter mapping:
  event_parameters: {
    value: {{DLV - apiValue}},
    // Map other important parameters you want to use
  }
  2. If you need to use the numeric value for comparisons (like "apiValue > 500000"), ensure it's passed as a number, not a string.

  Your audience definition might then look like:
  - Users who triggered "api_value" event with value > 500000 AND
  - Had campaign_name = "T1_CASH_sell_Google/SP" in their "campaign_data" event

  This gives you a powerful way to segment users based on both their campaign source and their specific actions/values on your site.
