```

## Code Migration Guide

### 1. Firebase Service (replaces `zoho.js`)

Create a new service file `src/services/firebase.js` with these core functions:

```javascript
// Core lead management functions
export async function submitLeadToFirebase(formData) { /* ... */ }
export async function updateLeadInFirebase(leadId, formData) { /* ... */ }
export async function trackFirebaseConversion(event, leadId, status, customValue, additionalData) { /* ... */ }
```

### 2. Firebase Authentication

```javascript
// Authentication service
export async function login(email, password) { /* ... */ }
export async function logout() { /* ... */ }
export function getCurrentUser() { /* ... */ }
```

### 3. React Components

Create new components for the admin interface:
- `src/components/Admin/Dashboard.jsx`
- `src/components/Admin/LeadList.jsx`
- `src/components/Admin/LeadDetail.jsx`

Create new components for the sales rep interface:
- `src/components/SalesRep/Dashboard.jsx`
- `src/components/SalesRep/LeadList.jsx`
- `src/components/SalesRep/LeadDetail.jsx`

### 4. Analytics Integration

Maintain the existing GTM integration by ensuring all conversion events are still pushed to the dataLayer:

```javascript
// In firebase.js
function pushToDataLayer(event, leadId, data) {
  if (window.dataLayer) {
    window.dataLayer.push({
      event: 'crmConversion',
      crmEvent: event,
      leadId: leadId,
      ...data
    });
  }
}
```

## Budget Considerations

- Firebase Pricing (Free Spark Plan limits):
  - Authentication: 10,000 monthly active users
  - Firestore: 1GB storage, 50,000 reads/day, 20,000 writes/day
  - Functions: 2M invocations/month
  
- Twilio Pricing (per usage):
  - Voice: ~$0.013/minute
  - SMS: ~$0.0075/message
  
- Estimated monthly cost for startup phase (<1000 leads/month):
  - Firebase: Free tier sufficient
  - Twilio: $50-100/month depending on usage
  
- Cost scaling (1000+ leads/month):
  - Firebase: $25-50/month
  - Twilio: $100-200/month

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Data Loss Risk**: Keep multiple database backups
2. **Functionality Gap**: Ensure all key requirements are met before go-live
3. **Adoption Issues**: Provide training sessions and detailed documentation
4. **Performance Concerns**: Implement Firebase performance monitoring from day one

## Success Metrics

1. **Migration Completeness**: 100% of required functionality implemented in Firebase
2. **User Adoption**: All sales reps actively using new system within 1 week post-launch
3. **Performance**: Page load times under 1.5 seconds, operation times under 0.5 seconds
4. **Cost Reduction**: Lower monthly cost compared to Zoho subscription
