# CRM Notification System Guide

This guide explains the different notification methods available in your SellForCash CRM system and how to set them up.

## Notification Methods

### 1. SMS Notifications via Twilio

SMS notifications are sent to sales representatives and administrators when a lead is assigned. This provides immediate notification of new leads requiring action.

**Setup Requirements:**
- Twilio account with active phone number
- Environment variables set in Vercel:
  - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
  - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
  - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`
  - `ADMIN_PHONE_NUMBER`
- Valid phone numbers for all sales reps in their user profiles

### 2. Email Notifications via Firebase Extensions

Email notifications can be sent for various lead events. These provide more detailed information than SMS and can include links to the CRM.

**Setup Requirements:**
- Firebase Extension "Trigger Email" installed in your Firebase project
- Email templates created in the Firebase Extension:
  - `lead-assignment` - For notifying sales reps of new assignments
  - `admin-new-lead` - For notifying admins of new leads
- Admin email configured in Notification Settings

### 3. In-App Notifications (Future Enhancement)

Real-time in-app notifications can be implemented using Firebase Firestore listeners, allowing users to see notifications while using the CRM.

### 4. Firebase Cloud Messaging (Web Push)

Browser push notifications can be implemented using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to notify users even when they don't have the CRM open.

### 5. Webhook Integrations (Future Enhancement)

Webhooks can be used to send notifications to external systems like Slack, Discord, or other business tools.

## Configuration

### Admin Dashboard Settings

1. **Auto-Assignment Settings:**
   - Enable/disable auto-assignment
   - Configure lead distribution logic
   - Manually trigger assignment for unassigned leads

2. **Notification Settings:**
   - Configure admin email address
   - Enable/disable email notifications
   - Enable/disable SMS notifications
   - Select which events trigger notifications

### User Management

Each sales representative should have:
- A valid phone number (with country code) for SMS notifications
- A valid email address for email notifications

## Notification Workflows

### New Lead Creation

1. Lead is submitted through website form
2. Lead is created in Firebase
3. If auto-assignment is enabled, lead is assigned to a sales rep
4. Admin receives email notification of new lead
5. If assigned, sales rep receives SMS and email notifications

### Lead Assignment

1. Admin manually assigns a lead or auto-assignment occurs
2. Sales rep receives SMS notification with lead details and CRM link
3. Sales rep receives email notification with complete lead details
4. Admin receives notification confirming the assignment

## Setting Up Firebase Email Extension

To enable email notifications, you'll need to install the "Trigger Email" extension in your Firebase project:

1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Extensions
2. Find and install "Trigger Email"
3. Configure SMTP settings (can use SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
4. Create email templates:

**Lead Assignment Template:**
```html
<h2>New Lead Assigned</h2>
<p>Hello {{salesRepName}},</p>
<p>A new lead has been assigned to you:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Name:</strong> {{leadName}}</li>
  <li><strong>Address:</strong> {{leadAddress}}</li>
  <li><strong>Phone:</strong> {{leadPhone}}</li>
  <li><strong>Email:</strong> {{leadEmail}}</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="{{leadURL}}">View lead details in CRM</a></p>
<p>Assigned on: {{assignedDate}}</p>
```

**Admin New Lead Template:**
```html
<h2>New Lead Created</h2>
<p>A new lead has been created in your CRM:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Name:</strong> {{leadName}}</li>
  <li><strong>Address:</strong> {{leadAddress}}</li>
  <li><strong>Phone:</strong> {{leadPhone}}</li>
  <li><strong>Email:</strong> {{leadEmail}}</li>
  <li><strong>Source:</strong> {{leadSource}}</li>
  <li><strong>Campaign:</strong> {{campaignName}}</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="{{leadURL}}">View lead details in CRM</a></p>
<p>Created on: {{createdDate}}</p>
```

## Troubleshooting

### SMS Notifications

If SMS notifications aren't working:
- Check Twilio credentials in Vercel environment variables
- Verify phone numbers are in E.164 format (e.g., +15551234567)
- Check Twilio logs for delivery issues
- Ensure your Twilio account has sufficient funds

### Email Notifications

If email notifications aren't working:
- Verify Firebase Extension "Trigger Email" is properly installed
- Check email templates exist and are correctly formatted
- Ensure admin email is correctly set in Notification Settings
- Check Firebase functions logs for any errors

## Future Enhancements

1. **Notification Preferences** - Allow users to set their preferred notification methods
2. **Notification History** - Track and display notification history
3. **Custom Notifications** - Allow creating custom notification triggers
4. **Mobile App Notifications** - Add push notifications for mobile apps
